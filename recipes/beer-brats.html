    <h3>Brats with onions</h3>
    <p>
        Beer brats are simmered with onions in beer for extra flavor, then finished up on the grill for a crispy, charred exterior. 
        Place them in hot dog rolls and top them with the tender onions and mustard, or serve them alongside German potato salad.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (12 ounce) cans of beer</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>10 bratwurst</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine beer adn onion slices in a large pot; bring to a boil. Add Bratwurst, pepper flakes, garlic powder,
            salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and cook for 10 to 12 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove bratwurst to a plate. Reduce heat to low and let onions summer until needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook bratwurst on the preheated grill, turning occasionally to get char marks, until no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 10 minutes. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
