            <p>
                Bacon, an American Breakfast staple, is made by first curing cuts of pork belly with a mixture
                of salt and seasonings. Once you have tried Home cured bacon, you will never go to the store again! 
                It does take a while to get from raw pork belly to savory cooked bacon, but trust me it is worth the wait.
                Just about anything can be added to the cure to give your bacon different flavors. For simplicity, 
                I am going to outline my standard Home Cured Bacon recipe.
            </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>one pork belly (about 10 lbs)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of kosher salt</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons of prague powder</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 of fresh ground pepper</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prep the pork belly. This means to trim off any unwanted pieces, and make it more square if not already. 
                    Sometimes the silver skin is still attached which can be removed as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next we need to make the cure. Combine the salt, prague powder, sugar, and pepper in a bowl till evenly combined
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cover the whole pork belly evenly with the cure. It helps to gently pat the cure onto the belly to help it stick.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now we need to let the belly covered in the curing mixture to sit for 10 days in a refrigerator. I like put it in 
                    a vacuum sealed bag. To get the belly to fit, I need to cut it in half. It is best practice to flip the belly over ever day, 
                    or every other day to ensure an even cure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After 10 days have passed, take the belly out of the bag. There will be some fluid in the bag that was pulled out of 
                    the belly due to the salt cure. Do a quick rinse of the belly under water to knock off some of the extra salt (this 
                    helps make sure the bacon is not to salty). Next put the pork belly on a baking rack back in the refrigerator over night. 
                    This will cause a sticky surface to form on the outside that will allow the smoke to stick better.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now we set up the smoker. Use your preferred wood, I always like a fruit wood. Keep the temperature as low as possible 
                    without letting the fire go out. We just want to add smoke flavor, not actually cook it. Once the smoke is rolling, put 
                    on the cured pork belly for 2 hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After 2 hours, remove the pork belly and set aside to let cool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After the Pork Belly is fully cured, it is time to make Bacon! Slice the pork belly to your desired bacon thickness (a 
                    meat slicer comes in real handy here). Fry up some bacon and enjoy! Vacuum seal and freeze the rest as you will have 
                    will have 10 pounds of bacon!
